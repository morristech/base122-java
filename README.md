# Base122 Encoder and Decoder

WIP

## Build

### Jar Sign

If you want to jar sign you need to provide a file `keystore.jks` in the
root folder with the correct credentials set in environment variables (
`OPENSOURCE_PROJECTS_KS_PW` and `OPENSOURCE_PROJECTS_KEY_PW`); alias is
set as `pfopensource`.

If you want to skip jar signing just change the skip configuration in the
`pom.xml` jar sign plugin to true:

    <skip>true</skip>

### Build with Maven

Use maven (3.1+) to create a jar including all dependencies

    mvn clean install
